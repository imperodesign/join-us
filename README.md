## Your way to Impero

The goal of this test is to build a simple news website that displays articles.

To start we want to make sure you know your way around git, clone this repository into your computer.

To create the application you'll need the latest version of node.js and npm. We're pretty sure you can sort that out yourself.

All you need now is to fire up your editor of choice and complete the following tasks:

### 1 - Create a simple data store with CRUD methods

To start building our website we'll first need a data store to create some articles, we will also need CRUD methods to allow our client to create, update and delete the articles from the website.

The articles should have at least a title, body text, author, publish date and tags.

You can choose how you're going to save this data, in memory, a database, a file or any other creative way you can think of, it's up to you.

### 2 - Expose the CRUD methods of your new model by building an API

Build an api that exposes the methods in your new model. You can use whatever library you wish, we usually use express or hapi.

### 3 - Create a front end for the website

Now we need something to show our articles, so let's create a simple front end. Again using your library of choice create a route that will render the list of all articles.

We also need a page where we show the full article, create a new route that shows individual articles.

### Optional

If you want to showcase some front end javascript skills you could go ahead and build a SPA instead. Feel free to use any frameworks you like, surprise us!
