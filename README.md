## Your way to Impero

To start we want to make sure you know your way around git, fork this repo and clone it.

To run the application you'll need the latest version of node.js and npm. We're pretty sure you can sort that out yourself.

Using the command line navigate into the project folder and run `npm test`
As you can see we've prepared a series of unit tests to make sure our code is working as expected. Right now all the tests should be failing, by the end of this exercise you should have all the tests passing.

### 1 - Create a simple data store with CRUD methods

To start building our website we'll first need a data store to store products, we will also need CRUD methods to allow our client to create, update and delete products from website. 

You can choose how you're going to save this data, in memory, a database, a file or any other creative way you can think of, it's up to you.

This will live inside `models/product.js`
